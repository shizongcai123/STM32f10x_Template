## CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard): It contains the standard software interface specifications for ARM Cortex-M processor cores. It provides a set of standardized APIs and data structures for accessing the processor and peripherals. This folder includes necessary header and source files to support low-level system initialization and interrupt handling.

## Device: It contains device-specific files for a particular chip model. These files describe the registers, peripheral addresses, and functionalities of the chip, which are used during programming.

## Libraries: This folder contains library files for different peripherals. Each subfolder represents a specific peripheral, such as GPIO, USART, SPI, etc. Inside each peripheral folder, you can find related header and source files, along with functions for initializing and configuring the peripherals.

## Projects: It includes some sample projects that demonstrate the usage of the STM32 microcontroller and its peripherals. These projects serve as references for developing your own applications and provide examples of how to configure and use different features of the microcontroller.

These folders collectively provide the necessary resources and code to develop firmware for STM32 microcontrollers using the standard firmware library.
